# Virtual MoCap: Optical Tracking Systems Design

## üîç Overview

This repository contains the software developed for a **Digital Twin for Optical Tracking Systems Design**. The tool was designed to simulate, evaluate, and optimize motion capture systems within a virtual environment, built using *Python* and robotics simulation. The DT is currently integrated to *CoppeliaSim* but multi-platform integrations can be explored.  

## üîñ Features

- **Configurable Camera Setup**: Easily adjust camera poses, resolutions, focal lengths, lens distortion parameters, and other intrinsic values;
- **Lighting & Noise Simulation**: Simulate real-world lighting and sensor noise to test how they affect tracking accuracy;
- **Synthetic Data Generation**: Create and export synthetic datasets for performance benchmarking;
- **Marker-based Tracking**: Evaluate tracking performance with adjustable marker configurations, including position, trajectory, and size;
- **Performance Analysis**: Tools for visualizing and calculating reconstruction errors to compare against ground truth values.

## üèóÔ∏è Installation 

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/loolirer/VirtualMoCap.git
    cd VirtualMoCap
    ```
2. Install required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Ensure **CoppeliaSim 4.6.0 (rev. 16)** is installed to interact with the Python client.

## ‚öîÔ∏è Usage

1. Start CoppeliaSim and load the appropriate scene;
2. Customize camera configurations and parameters in the jupyter notebooks or the CoppeliaSim scenes to match your desired setup;
3. Run the Python scripts provided to control the simulation and capture data;
4. Analyse the data to your liking.

## üß™ Experiments 

This software replicates the experiments outlined in **["Optical tracking system based on COTS components"](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10053039)**, adapting the system to a virtual environment. Please refer to the paper for a deeper understanding of the experimental setup and results.

The results of this experiment were submitted in **["A digital twin for optical tracking systems design"]()** for [ICARA 2025](https://www.icara.us).
