    "# Creating the Server's UDP Socket\n",

    "The information bellow is taken from the GeeksForGeeks's website and is available [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/differences-between-tcp-and-udp/).\n",
    "\n",
    "## The User Datagram Protocol\n",
    "\n",
    "User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is a Transport Layer Protocol. UDP is a part of the Internet Protocol suite, referred to as the UDP/IP suite. Unlike the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), it is an unreliable and connectionless protocol. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, there is no need to establish a connection before data transfer. The UDP helps to establish **low-latency** and **loss-tolerating** connections establish over the network. The UDP enables process-to-process communication - an event based communication.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Used for simple request-response communication when the size of data is less and hence there is lesser concern about flow and error control.\n",
    "- It is a suitable protocol for multicasting as UDP supports packet switching.\n",
    "- UDP is used for some routing update protocols like RIP (Routing Information Protocol).\n",
    "- Normally used for real-time applications which can not tolerate uneven delays between sections of a received message.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages of UDP\n",
    "- It does not require any connection for sending or receiving data;\n",
    "- Broadcast and Multicast are available in UDP;\n",
    "- UDP can operate on a large range of networks;\n",
    "- UDP has live and real-time data;\n",
    "- UDP can deliver data if all the components of the data are not complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Disadvantages of UDP\n",
    "- We can not have any way to acknowledge the successful transfer of data;\n",
    "- UDP cannot have the mechanism to track the sequence of data;\n",
    "- UDP is connectionless, and due to this, it is unreliable to transfer data;\n",
    "- In case of a Collision, UDP packets are dropped by routers in comparison to TCP;\n",
    "- UDP can drop packets in case of detection of errors.\n",
