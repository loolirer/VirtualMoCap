    "\n",
    "This notebook is a study about the epipolar geometry and point triangulation using *CoppeliaSim* as a simulator to verify results in a virtual environment. \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to verify if the data generated between math and simulation is coherent. For this:\n",
    "1. Instanciate two Vision Sensors in both *CoppeliaSim*;\n",
    "2. Create a 3D scene with detectable points in the space;\n",
    "3. Use epipolar geometry to find point to point correspondences;\n",
    "4. Triangulate points;\n",
    "5. Check if triangulated position matches the ground truth position of the points. \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to make a triangulation with the least amount of reconstruction error. \n",
